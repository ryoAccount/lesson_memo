## 1.What are your thoughts on Japan's goal to increase public AI use?

I think this is a positive news.
Because AI supports us to resolve a variety of issues.
For example, examining new technologies and practicing English.

## 2.Are you surprised that only 27% of people in Japan have used generative AI?

To be honest, I wasn't surprised to hear 27%.
I don't think this number 27% is accurate.
I believe many Japanese business people usually take advantage of generative AI in their work.
If I couldn't take advantage of generative AI, my productivity would decrease.

## 3.Why do you think Japan has been slow to adopt AI?

Because I think Japanese isn't good at top down management.
Deciding to something with everyone is one of the Japanese traditional customs even if business or school.
It's too tough to manage everyone because there are many opinions from others.
So we need a lot of time to adopt something.

## 4.Do you think that expanding the use of AI in all areas of society will support development?

Yes, I think so.
Unfortunately, the number of Japanese children decrease in year.
I think we have to rely on generative AI to maintain society in the future.
I believe some sort of jobs replace generative AI.
For example, receptionist, web designer and translator and so on.

## 5.Do you think that supporting AI development is essential for Japan's economy?

It's a tough question. I don't know it.
I'm not sure that developers can create generative AI with high quality if supporting AI development.

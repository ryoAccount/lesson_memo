If countdown would take place, Shibuya will be more dirty with garbages.

Yes, there are New Year's Eve celebrations in the large shrine near my house every year.

I'm going to ring the bell with my son if we don't fall asleep until New Year's Day.

This money is called "Otoshidama" and this is one of the traditional cultures in Japan.
Unfortunately, my money was saved to my parent's bank account by my parents.

Definitely, I prefer a small celebration.
A big celebration may be loud and hard to prepare.
I like silent and leisure atmosphere places.

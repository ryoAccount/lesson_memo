## 1. Did you know about the two sleep tradition before reading the article?

No, I didn't know about it.
I thought sleep habits didn't change between the past and the present.

## 2. Do you think having two separate sleeps at night would work for you?

I don't think so.
I want to keep my sleep time as short as possible because I have a lot of what I want to do.
If I split my sleep time, I may sleep more than an usual day.

## 3. Do you often wake up in the middle of the night? Do you find it easy to get back to sleep?

No, I hardly wake up in the middle of sleep.
However, I accidentally wake up when my kids kick or punch me during my kids also are sleeping.
I always sleep with my family on the same bed.

## 4. Do you try to keep the same bedtime most nights?

Yes, I usually go to sleep at 1 am or 2 am every day.
I study English or Cybersecurity before sleeping.
I try to sleep at least 4 or 5 hours.

## 5. How have your sleeping habits changed over time?

My sleep habits changed when I was over thirty years old.
Because my son was born and I had an opportunity to lead a team for work.
That meant, I was busy every day at that time.

## What are your thoughts on the study's findings?
I agree this study's findings.
I sometimes feel I may also a perfectionist.
Because I feel the pain when I can't live up to expectations from my coworkers and upper managements.

## Do you know anyone you'd describe as a perfectionist?
I think some of my coworkers are perfectionists.
Because my coworkers took a long time off due to their mental health.
I think they had some of the pains until they had to rest their work.
However, I don't know why they take a time off, so I don't say to be sure.

## Do you tend to be hard on yourself?
Maybe yes, I think so.
My wife sometimes says "you're a worker holic."
I don't usually take my paid leave unless any special reasons.
And I often assume a responsibility from others.

## Have you ever set unrealistic or unachievable goals for yourself?
I didn't have ever set unrealistic or unachievable goals.
But I thought that to communicate with English was unrealistic goals until I started to study English.
Now that I believe I could fluently talk with a native some day.

## Why do you think so many people find it hard to be kind to themselves?
Because I think many serious employees feel they need to work more to survive in the business world.
I also feel I have to work hard and need to get some of skills such as English and technologies.
I don't know when someone fire nowaday.

## Do you know anyone who's always too hard on themselves?
Yes, I know that person. It's my colleague.
He always works too late and overtime.
And he barely rests his work every day.

## Are you more forgiving with others than you are with yourself?
Yes, I think so.
I can allow others mistakes, but I sometime can't allow my mistakes.
I try to calm down possible if I feel angry to myself.

## Who are the most positive people you know?
I think most people who like themselves are positive.
Such as a narcissist and an idol.
Fortunately, I have no friends such as these people.

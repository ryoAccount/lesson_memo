## 1.What are your thoughts on the study's findings?

I agree this study's findings.
I sometimes feel I may also a perfectionist.
Because I feel the pain when I can't live up to expectations from my coworkers and upper managements.

## 2.Do you know anyone you'd describe as a perfectionist?

Yes, I know a perfectionist. That is my coworker.
He barely rests his work and he has a responsibility for his team's output.
And he often work overtime.

## 3.Do you tend to be hard on yourself?

Maybe yes, I think so.
I don't usually take my paid leave unless any special reasons.
And I try to work when I'm sick.

## 4.Have you ever set unrealistic or unachievable goals for yourself?

I didn't have ever set unrealistic or unachievable goals.
But I thought to communicate with English was unrealistic goals until I started to study English.
Now that I believe I could fluently talk with a native speaker some day.

## 5.Why do you think so many people find it hard to be kind to themselves?

Because I think many serious employees feel they need to work more to survive in the business world.
I also feel I have to work hard and I need to get some skills such as English and technologies.

## 1.Do you know anyone who's always too hard on themselves?

Yes, I know that person. It's my coworker.
He always works too late and overtime.
And he barely rests his work.

## 2.Are you more forgiving with others than you are with yourself?

Yes, I think so.
I can allow others mistakes, but I sometime can't allow my mistakes.
I try to calm down possible if I feel angry to myself.

## 3.Who are the most positive people you know?

I don't know a positive person.
To be precise, I don't know most people I know are whether positive or negative.
